*GLSL raymarching within TouchDesigner*
------

I'm in process of making templates and video totorial for helping to do raymarching (RM) in TouchDesigner.

**SDF tests.toe** — Performance test with two different approaches to sampling coordinates and GLSL code from two different RM tutorials

**template - basic.toe** — Basic raymarcher template for creating everything using vector uniforms

**template - array.toe** — Variation of a basic raymarcher template for creating geometry from texture buffer array

**tutorial - part 1.toe** — Supplementary file for a Part I of the tutorial. Main covered topic is describing a scene for RM using two approaches: basic uniforms and hard-coded variables for creating a geometry and an texture buffer array for using CHOP data in a loop.
